The traveling salesman problem implemented in Clingo.

Clingo is a declarative programming languaged descened from Prolog.

The clingo implementation is declarative, and thus not exactly the greedy algorithm, but in the background gringo is using greedy algorithms.

In order to run this program, clingo 4.5.4 or later is required.

It's available free here : http://potassco.sourceforge.net/ 

The command to run the program is:

clingo tsp.lp

Clingo does not take inputs from I/O, so all of the information regarding the traveling salesman problem is within the file.

The path() terms indicate the paths from city to city available to the salesman.
The place() terms are the cities and their names.
The const t is the number of cities the salesman is planning to visit.
The first location variable indicates the salesman's starting city.

The program will output UNSATISFIABLE if there's no way to visit all of the cities and return to the home city without visiting any cities twice.

Otherwise, it will output SATISFIABLE and list the steps to the smallest possible path in the form of:

travel(City, Time).
