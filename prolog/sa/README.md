# This is my SWI - Prolog Solution for the Traveling Salesman Solution

This solution is supposed to be of a Simulated Annealing Algorithm



To run the program right now, 

run the command on the terminal/ command line, 

 swipl  main.pl -t main --quiet -- example.tsp
 
 
where example.tsp is the file you would like to parse. 

You must have swipl installing on your computer in order to run this.


Im limited in knowledge of prolog, so I do not know how to/ if it is possible to make a make-file for this solution at the moment, sorry
