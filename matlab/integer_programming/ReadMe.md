    for serving as a guide to an integer programming formulation of the TSP problem 

------------------------
 How to execute this program
 [1] enter "echo "TSP_solver_functional('a280.tsp')" | matlab -nosplash -nodesktop , in the command line
[2] wait, and end results will display
[3] View results in file "solution.txt"
    Note :: this is a set of n (longitude,latitude) pairs of city data
   And there is no particular order. Joining these edges though, should reuslt in the TSP solution
