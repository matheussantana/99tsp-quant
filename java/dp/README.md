I solved the TSP through a DP algorithm. Naturally, the DP algorithm is very hard to follow, but there are
some simplified resources that help explain what I was doing on wikipedia and through Google Searches.

Both the runtime and the space complexity of this algorithm are O(n^2* 2^n). I would not recommend running this problem
on a large problem set (the problem set I used is sized 14) as the heap will overflow with any dataset that is too large.
